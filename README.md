# IoT Voice Control Home Automation System

This project is an IoT-based voice control home automation system designed for geriatric assistance. It can control up to 6 devices, monitor load, and detect smoke and fire for safe and smooth operation.

## Features
- Control up to 6 devices via voice commands or mobile app.
- Load monitoring with ACS712-20A current sensor.
- Smoke detection using MQ series sensors.
- Fire detection using a flame sensor.
- Uses ESP8266 microcontroller.
- Controlled and monitored via the BLYNK app.

## Components
- ESP8266 Microcontroller
- ACS712-20A Current Sensor
- Flame Sensor
- MQ Series Smoke Sensor
- BLYNK App

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Upload the code to the ESP8266 using Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the hardware components as per the schematics.
4. Install the BLYNK app on your mobile device and configure it with the provided code.
5. Run the system and control devices via voice commands or the mobile app.
